# Binary Convolutional Code (BCC)
Error Correcting Codes - Binary Convolutional Code

> Binary Convolutional Codes (BCC) are a type of error-correcting code used in digital communication systems to mitigate the effects of noise and interference during transmission. This repository provides a collection of C++ implementations of various BCC encoder and decoder algorithms, along with accompanying documentation and examples.

## Contents

1. **`encoder.cpp`**: Encryption algorithm codes with 2 shift registers.
2. **`decoder.cpp`**: Decoding algorithm codes with recursive functions.
3. **`node.cpp`**: Node data type that contain the information of the next nodes and distances and the current state.
4. **`Driver.cpp`**: The set of codes used to receive bits from the user and display the output.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or higher)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Clone and Compile

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saeidEmadi/BinaryConvolutionalCode.git
   ```
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
    cd BinaryConvolutionalCode
   ```
3. Compile the source files using your preferred C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ encoder.cpp decoder.cpp node.cpp Driver.cpp -o Driver
   ```
### run and enjoy it :)
